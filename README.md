## How to make a README

Things to include:

1. Project title
2. Project description (keep it brief)
  - What does it do? <projectname> is a <utility/tool/data/script> that allows <whoever you're making this for> to do <whatever this package does>.
  - Brief justification of why you made this.
  - List dependencies (things that you need in order to make this work).
  - Known challenges, bugs, or planned future features
3. (Optional) Table of Contents
4. Link to an in-depth guide, tutorials, etc.
5. How to install
6. How to use
7. Credits
8. License
9. How to contribute to project (if contributions wanted)

Style considerations: light friendly tone, brief, minimize jargon, demonstrate snippets/commands
